VZControl - v0.6.0
=========

A CLI environment to monitor/administrate multiple OpenVZ Host machines and the containers on them. It is written in
php5, and uses standard tools such as vzctl and vzmigrate to facilitate all actions.

Overview
--------

VzControl is run from a command line, and gives you an interface to perform actions very easily. All commands are
based on the standard *nix utility names, so the learning curve should be minimal. The actions include
the following and more.

- List containers on some/all OpenVZ Hosts
- Start/Stop/Restart containers
- List/Download templates to OpenVZ Hosts
- Migrate containers from one OpenVZ Host to another (offline and online)
- Create a new container
- Shutdown/Reboot an OpenVZ Host
- Run custom commands on an OpenVZ Host
- Tab auto-complete of commands and containers


Quick Start (Debian)
--------------------

Install php5 pear

    apt-get install php5-cli php-pear php5-dev build-essential libpcre3-dev
    pecl install --alldeps phar

Edit suhosin to allow phar and hoa to run

    nano /etc/php/conf.d/suhosin.ini

Change `;suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = `  
to `suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = "phar,hoa"`

Download vzcontrol (compiled)  
`wget https://raw.github.com/mrkmg/vzcontrol/master/out/vzcontrol`

Make vzcontrol executable  
`chmod +x vzcontrol`

Create the default config file

    mrkmg$ ./vcontrol -m

If you are running this on a machine that is not one of your OpenVZ Hosts, remove the default server

    VZControl> removehost local

Add in your hosts

    VZControl> addhost serv1 full.host.name
    VZControl> addhost serv2 1.2.3.4
    VZControl> addhost serv3 1.2.3.5 1222   #Uses port 1222 for SSH

Write the config

    VZControl> writeconfig

List running containers on all hosts

    VZControl> ls

List all containers on all hosts

    VZControl> lsa

List running containers on serv1

    VZControl> ls serv1

Download a new template to serv3

    VZControl> install serv3 debian-6.0_X86_64

View a detailed list of all commands

    VZControl> help all

Prerequisites
------------

**Debain 6.0**

Install php5 and pear

    apt-get install php5-cli php-pear php5-dev build-essential libpcre3-dev
    pecl install --alldeps phar

Edit suhosin to allow phar and hoa to run

    nano /etc/php/conf.d/suhosin.ini

Change `;suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = ` to `suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = "phar,hoa"`

**CentOS 6**

Install php5 and mbstring
    yum install php-cli php-mbstring


Installation
------------

**Requirements**

- For each OpenVZ Host you plan on controlling, ssh keys for the root account must be shared to all other hosts

**Optional**

- Share the ssh key from the computer you are running vzcontrol on with all OpenVZ Hosts

**Steps**

1. Either clone the repo or download only the packaged script
    - `git clone https://github.com/mrkmg/vzcontrol.git`
    - `wget https://raw.github.com/mrkmg/vzcontrol/master/out/vzcontrol`
2. Make vzcontrol executable
    - `chmod +x vzcontrol`
3. Either manually create a config file or have vzcontrol generate a sample file for you
    - `./vzcontrol make` This creates a config file at `~/.vzcontrol.conf`
4. Put all the servers in your cluster into the config file (See Configuration Below) or add them via the vzcontrol interface
5. *Optional* Symlink the script to PATH
    - `sudo ln -s /path/to/repo/out/vzcontrol /usr/bin/vzcontrol` If cloned from repo
    - `sudo ln -s /path/to/downloads/vzcontrol /usr/bin/vzcontrol` If downloaded only the script
6. Run vzcontrol
    - `./out/vzcontrol` If cloned from repo
    - `./vzcontrol` If downloaded
    - `vzcontrol` If symlinked

Configuration
-------------

vzcontrol uses a configuration file to determine which servers it is able to administer. The file is very easy to understand. The file must be in the following format

    ;Sample vzcontrol.conf

    ;This is the shortname of server, something you could easily remember. Usually the systems hostname shortened
    [shortname]
    ;Every server must have a host
    host = shortname.domain.tld
    ;Port is optional, this specifies what port SSH runs on. Defaults to 22
    port = 2222

    [server2]
    host = server2.host.tld

    [server3]
    host = 1.2.3.4

You can also dynamically create this file via the vzcontrol command interface. For example, if you are starting from scratch.

    mrkmg$ vzcontrol -m
    ######################################
    #             VZControl              #
    #           OpenVZ Manager           #
    #                                    #
    # Created By MrKMG <kevin@mrkmg.com> #
    # Type `help` to start               #
    #                             v0.5.2 #
    ######################################

    VZControl> removehost local
    VZControl> addhost name1 host.domain
    VZControl> addhost name2 1.2.4.5 2222
    VZControl> writeconfig

The about command remove the sample servers added, adds two new servers, and then writes the config file.

Building
--------

**Requirements**

- PHP 5.3
    - php.ini must have "phar.readonly = Off"
- SSH 
- For each OpenVZ Host you plan on controlling, ssh keys for the root account must be shared to all other hosts

**Optional**

- Share the ssh key from the computer you are running vzcontrol on with all OpenVZ Hosts

**Steps**

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/mrkmg/vzcontrol.git`
2. Enter Dir `cd vzcontrol`
3. Build: `./build` to just build or `./build install` to build and symlink to /usr/bin/vzcontrol


Usage
-----

After you have built and configured vzcontrol, you can launch it from the out directory.

If you did symlink the script: `vzcontrol`  
If you did not symlink: `./out/vzcontrol`

Command Link Switches:

-h   Show the help
-c   Define a custom config (Defaults to ~/.vzcontrol.conf)
-m   Make a default config file
-s   Temp Location for SSH Sockets (If set to same for multiple instances they we will share sockets)
-v   Turn on verbose mode (Warnings only)
-vv  Turn on verbose mode (Warnings and logs)
